- The storage backend is untrusted and is used to durably store encrypted data. When the Vault server is started, it must be provided with a storage backend so that data is available across restarts.

### Seal/Unsealing Process
- Once started, the Vault is in a sealed state. Before any operation can be performed on the Vault it must be unsealed. This is done by providing the unseal keys. 
  When the Vault is initialized it generates an encryption key which is used to protect all the data. That key is protected by a master key. 
  By default, Vault uses a technique known as Shamir's secret sharing algorithm to split the master key into 5 shares, any 3 of which are required to reconstruct the master key.

The number of shares and the minimum threshold required can both be specified. Shamir's technique can be disabled, and the master key can be used directly for unsealing. 
Once Vault retrieves the encryption key, it is able to decrypt the data in the storage backend, and enters the unsealed state. Once unsealed, Vault loads all of the configured audit devices, auth methods, and secrets engines.

### Integrated Storage

Vault uses Raft as the underlying storage mechanism.

Here are some key points related to Vault's use of Raft for integrated storage:

#### Raft Consensus Algorithm:

Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm designed to ensure consistency and fault tolerance in a distributed system.
Vault leverages Raft to provide a highly available and fault-tolerant storage backend.

#### Integrated Storage:

Integrated Storage in Vault is an option where the Vault server and its storage backend are bundled into a single binary, simplifying the deployment process.
Raft is the default storage backend used with Integrated Storage.

#### High Availability (HA) with Raft:

Integrated Storage with Raft supports high availability setups by allowing multiple Vault nodes to form a Raft cluster.
The Raft consensus algorithm ensures that the nodes maintain a consistent and up-to-date view of the data.

#### Data Consistency:

Raft provides strong consistency guarantees, ensuring that all nodes in the Raft cluster agree on the order of operations.
Here is a simplified example of a Vault server configuration using Integrated Storage with Raft:

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path = "/vault/data"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "127.0.0.1:8200"
  tls_disable = 1
}
```
In this example, the storage block specifies the use of the Raft storage backend, and the path parameter defines the directory where Vault data will be stored.
