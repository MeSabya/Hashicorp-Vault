#  How kubernetes auth works in hashicorp vault ?

Certainly! The Kubernetes authentication method in HashiCorp Vault allows Kubernetes clusters and applications running within those clusters to authenticate with Vault. 
This integration helps manage and secure access to secrets and other resources 
in Vault based on Kubernetes identity. Here's an overview of how Kubernetes authentication works in HashiCorp Vault:

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

### Enable Kubernetes Auth Method:
Enable the Kubernetes authentication method in Vault.

```bash
curl --cacert /home/sysadmin/vault_ca.pem \
    --header "X-Vault-Token:$ROOT_TOKEN"  \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"type":"kubernetes","description":"kubernetes auth"}' \
    https://sva-vault-active.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200/v1/sys/auth/kubernetes
```

#### Explanation of the above command


### Configure Kubernetes Authentication:
Configure the Kubernetes authentication method in Vault with the necessary information to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.

### Create Role:
Define a role in Vault that specifies which Kubernetes Service Accounts are allowed to authenticate and the associated policies.

### Deploy Application:
Deploy your application in Kubernetes using the specified Service Account.

### Authenticate with Vault:
When the application starts, it uses its Service Account token to authenticate with Vault and obtain a Vault token.

### Use Vault Token:
The obtained Vault token can now be used to access secrets or perform other operations in Vault.

This integration allows applications running in Kubernetes to leverage their Kubernetes identity for authentication and authorization within HashiCorp Vault.
